# Financial Advisor Chatbot Backend

This is the backend server for the Financial Advisor chatbot. It uses Flask to create a simple API that interfaces with Google's Gemini AI model to provide financial advice and information.

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)

3. Set your API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   # On Windows
   set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

The server will start on http://localhost:5000

## API Endpoints

**Request Body:**

}
```

**Response:**

```

### GET /health

## Notes

- The chatbot provides general financial information and guidance.
- It does not provide specific investment recommendations or personalized financial advice that would require a licensed financial advisor.
- The backend uses Google's Gemini AI model, so responses are generated by the AI based on the context and knowledge it has been provided.
