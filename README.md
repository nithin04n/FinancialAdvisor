 FinancialAdvisor – Personal Finance Assistant Website

**FinancialAdvisor** is a user-friendly website that helps individuals make informed financial decisions through an AI-powered chatbot. The chatbot answers common finance-related queries including budgeting, emergency funds, credit scores, index funds, and retirement planning.

This project combines a React-based frontend with a Flask backend and uses a lightweight Hugging Face NLP model for intelligent question-answering. When the model lacks confidence, it falls back to rule-based logic to ensure reliable responses.
